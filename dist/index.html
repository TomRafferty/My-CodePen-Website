        This is Luke Kelly. Luke was a singer of the dubliners between 1962 and 1984(when he sadly died). He is regarded as one of the founding members of the band and is one of the only people to have two statues of them raised. He is an Irish legend and an inspiration to many. <a target="_blank" id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Kelly"> click for more information on luke</a>.

  <p class="center"><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <p class="center"> Luke Kelly was a huge part of the dubliners, but he wasn't always in the group. He left home at a young age to go to england and find himself. After passing through some work he decided that it wasn't the life for him and he began learning to sing and play. <br> He is quoted to say to his family "I'm going, and I wont be back until I'm a success" as mentioned in this incredible documentary <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPvodECpwjo"> Luke Kelly - The Performer </a>.

    <br>
    <p class="center">
      Luke was a founding member of the dubliners and helped start the group in 1962. this however was not set in stone as Luke left the group in 1964 for two years, though he did later join back after his replacement left the group. <br> The group recorded many hit records together including: <b>Seven Drunken Nights</b> and <b>Black Velvet Band</b> 
      <br>
      <br>Even though Luke had great success within the band, he absolutley stuck out as a solo artist especially after the arrival of Phil Coulter (composer) who had Luke perform such hits as: <b>Scorn Not His Simplicity</b> and <b>The Town I Loved So Well</b>.

      Luke Suffered with migraines and began to forget lyrics during performances.<br>
      Sadly after some time, a tumour was discovered on Luke's brain.<br>
      Even though his health was degrading Luke kept giving performances; his last of which was a performance of 'The Night Visiting Song'. <br>
      He performed this with other members of the dubliners infront of a live audience. Some of them were worried he may begin to forget the lyrics due to the complex nature of the song. <br>
      Nevertheless Luke gave an amazing performance. <br>
      Luke recorded one last song before his death, 'A Song For Ireland' was his last ever recording. <br>
      Not long after, Luke died on the 30th of January 1984 at the age of 44.

      Luke Kelly is an Irish legend and is held to a great height as one of Ireland's greatest ever recording artists. He sang of loss and sorrow, but also of joy and love. During the revival of folk music Luke and The Dubliners rose to fame and they donned that glory with pride. <br>
